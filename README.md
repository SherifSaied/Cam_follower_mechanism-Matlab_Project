# Cam_follower_mechanism-Matlab_Project
Design a code that calculates the dimensions and the shape of a cam that draws a certain motion desired for the follower according to the cam-follower mechanism as well as motion analysis using graphs and simulation. 

Cam-follower systems are frequently used in all kinds of machines. 
The valves in our automobile engines are open by cams.  Machines
used in the manufacture of many consumer goods are full of cams.  
Compared to linkages, cams are easier to design to give a specific
output function, but they are much more difficult and expensive to
manufacture than linkages.  
It is this conceptual difference that makes the cam-follower such a
flexible and useful function generator.  We can specify virtually any
output function we desire and quite likely create a curved surface on
the cam to generate that function in the motion of the follower. We
are not limited to fixed-length links as we were in linkage synthesis. 
The cam-follower is an extremely useful mechanical device, without
which the machine designerâ€™s tasks would be more difficult to
accomplish.
